# Dashboard informations
Hosted on AWS on an ec2 instance.
MobaXterm is used to push git modifications on the website/Dashboard and run the website.

# Loading steps of the Dashboard
When you load the Dashboard, it first calls the flask api on its api/load_data function.
Then it loads the informations about the first client and launches api/getdecision/id=100001.

# How the Dashboard is launched using MobaXterm
- Login on the ec2 instance with ubuntu login
- On the bash :
'''bash
$ cd OPC-Project_7/08_WEBSITE_AND_MODELS
$ sudo nohup streamlit run streamlit_front.py > log.txt 2>&1 &
